## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Python not found` | Reinstall Node.js and check "Install Python" |
| `Ollama not found after install` | Restart setup.bat after Ollama installer finishes |
| `AI model pull failed` | Make sure Ollama is running, try `ollama serve` in terminal |
| `Missing voice files` | Re-run setup.bat, it will skip already downloaded files |
| `Model not showing` | Make sure your .gltf file is in the `/models` folder |
| `No sound` | Check that kokoro_server.py is running (start.bat handles this) |
